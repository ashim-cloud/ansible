**Install ansible in Control Node, As am using Amazon Linux2 OS, Amazon-linux-extras will install all required dependencies**

```bash
sudo yum update -y && sudo yum upgrade -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo yum install ansible -y
```

verify ansible version by running below command

```bash
ansible --version
```

```bash
which ansible
```

```bash
ansible-config dump
```

**Create a common user for all ansible activities**

Creating a user, Here am using "ansibleusr" user and set password.

```bash
sudo useradd ansibleusr
```
```bash
sudo passwd ansibleusr
```

**Provide Sudeoer permissions**
```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add below entry to sudeor file.

```bash
ansibleusr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

```bash
sudo su - ansibleusr
```

**Enable SSH Connection across the instances.**

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
```bash
Set "PasswordAuthentication yes"
```

```bash
sudo service sshd restart
```

**Connect to all the nodes and Create common user same as Above.**

```bash
sudo useradd ansibleusr
sudo passwd ansibleusr
sudo visudo
ansibleusr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
sudo su - ansibleusr
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Set "PasswordAuthentication yes"
sudo service sshd restart
```

**Configure password-less authentication.**

*Perform this on Control Node*

Create an SSH Public key and Private Key in Server and Copy Public Key to across the instances. Make sure you are doing this as ansibleusr, and perform this from Control Node.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

```bash
ssh-copy-id ansibleusr@Managed-node-1/2/3
```

Now test the Password-less authentication. It should not prompt any password.

```bash
ssh Node-ip
```


***When we install ansible, we will get 3 IMP files under /etc/ansible***
1. ansible-config
2. hosts
3. roles

In "ansible-config" file, hosts file entry is commented default.

Create a group in hosts file (i.e; webservers / web-group / dbservers)


**Commands to verify hosts**

To list all the hosts ansible is managing run below command.

```bash
ansible all --list-hosts
```

You can also ping all/group of nodes.

```bash
ansible all -m ping -v
```

If you want to list the nodes from a specific group, use below command

```bash
ansible mygroup --list-hosts
```
